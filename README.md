# ZAMA DEVELOPER PROGRAM GUIDE

Welcome to the Zama Developer Program a step-by-step journey to learn how to create, deploy, and claim rewards for your Confidential Smart Contracts on Zama.

##  Let's Write Your First Confidential Smart Contract

- Visit this repo: https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-hardhat-template

- Try to fork this repo and open new codespace.

## LEVEL - 2 GUIDE: Prepare a Fresh Contracts Directory

Inside your codespace terminal, clear any existing contracts and create a new folder:

```bash
rm -rf contracts/*
mkdir contracts
touch contracts/Calculator.sol
```

### Write the Calculator Contract

- In the explorer sidebar, find the contracts directory.
- Right-click ‚Üí New File.
- Name it `Calculator.sol.`
- Paste this Solidity code into the file:

```bash
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Calculator {
    function encryptedAdd(uint32 a, uint32 b) public pure returns (uint32) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following commands to set up your project packages:

```bash
npm install
npm install @fhenixprotocol/contracts --save
```

### Compile Your Contract

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

‚úÖ If all goes well, you‚Äôll see a message confirming successful compilation.

## Complete Level 2

Head over to the Zama Guild and mark Level 2 as completed: https://guild.xyz/zama/developer-program

## LEVEL - 3 GUIDE: Deploy and Register Your Contract

### Create a Scripts Directory
Make a folder to store your deployment scripts:

```
mkdir scripts
```

### Add the Deployment Script
Create the deployment file:

```bash
touch scripts/deploy.js
```

Then open `deploy.js` and insert this JavaScript code:

```bash

// customized by CryptoWithShashi let's gooo

const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const Calculator = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Calculator");
  const calculator = await Calculator.deploy();
  await calculator.waitForDeployment();

  console.log("Calculator deployed to:", await calculator.getAddress());
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

### Deploy Your Smart Contract

Execute the deployment script:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

‚úÖ Your terminal will output the contract address, which looks something like:

```bash
Calculator deployed to: 0xYourContractAddress
```

- Copy this address ‚Äî you‚Äôll need it to claim your next level.

## Complete Level 3

- Go back to the Zama Guild page: https://guild.xyz/zama/developer-program

- Find Level 3: Deploy your confidential contract.
- Paste your contract address to verify your deployment.
